Coffee Order Analysis and Prediction


Aim: Our goal is to analyze customer coffee order data and predict key business metrics such as sales and profitability. This involves exploring customer behavior, product preferences, and trends in the coffee market.

*Description:*

We took the dataset from an Excel file containing three sheets: Customers, Orders, and Products, to perform the analysis.

Data preprocessing involved handling missing values, merging the sheets, and creating a unified dataset.

Visualized some important trends, such as sales distribution by country, product popularity, and top customers by revenue.

Conducted exploratory data analysis to identify patterns in customer preferences and product performance.

Built a predictive model using Linear Regression to forecast sales based on features like Quantity, Unit Price, and Coffee Type.

Addressed multicollinearity in the dataset by identifying problematic columns and resolving the issues through feature selection.

Applied feature engineering techniques and tested the model's performance, optimizing it with regularization methods to prevent overfitting.
